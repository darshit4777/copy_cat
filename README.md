# copy_cat

## Introduction
copy_cat is a pygame based ball-on-plate simulator. The user can use arrow keys to tilt the plate left or right or center it, in an effort to balance a rolling ping pong ball on a plate.</br>
</br>
The copy cat simulator was built for testing various control algorithms to solve a well known and interesting controls problem. Additionally its application can be extended to build Machine Learning models to control the plate.

## Installation

Just clone the repository and download dependencies from the requirements.txt. To do so, just use `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Start the game using `python3 visual.py` </br>
Use the arrow keys to tilt the plate, the game will restart if the ball falls off. 
</br>
Press the `s` key to enter into the data collection mode aka 'SharinGan' mode. This will start tracking all your moves to analyse.</br>
Press the `m` key to analyse all your moves and let machine learning do the controlling.</br>
</br>

Enjoy !
